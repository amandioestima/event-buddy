## 🛠 Firebase Setup

Before running the app, you'll need to set up Firebase and configure your environment:

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Enable Cloud Firestore
4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
   - Replace the dummy values with your Firebase configuration:
     ```bash
     FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
     FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
     FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
     FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
     FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
     FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
     ```
   - You can find these values in your Firebase project settings
   - Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to Git

⚠️ Important Security Note:
- The `.env` file contains sensitive information and is ignored by Git
- Never commit your real Firebase credentials to version control
- Each developer should maintain their own local `.env` file
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
